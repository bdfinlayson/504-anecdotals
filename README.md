# 504-anecdotals
This is my Nashville Software School capstone for the first half of the program covering the front-end stack (Javascript, HTML, and CSS). The app uses Firebase as a backend. Built using Angularjs. The charts were built using the D3 library. 

A link to the live app can be found here:

What: 
504s are for students who are not classified for special education but need more time to complete assignments.  

Why: 
Teachers need an easy way to keep track of and provide proof for 504 kids and present that data in a way that is easy to digest.

Who: 
For teachers who are looking for a structured way to track type of assessments, students, time needed and allotted, notes during test, and find amount of time accumulated to answer the question: how much more time do kids need on their tests?
